# Await/async experiments

This is a small set of experiments / explorations into the await/async feature described in PEP-0492 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/) and implemented in Python 3.5.


## Experiment 1 - Simplest scheduler.

The goal of experiment 1 is to have a essentially the simplest possible co-routine scheduler.
This is in juxtaposition to the relatively complex schedulers found in the standard asyncio module.
